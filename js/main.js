/*

This is the JS file we'll be working out of. We'll be building a website that
will allow you to build custom cards for any occasion, including birthdays.
The user will enter the URL of the image they want to use as a background, their
name, and what text they want on the card.

To accomplish this, we'll edit what's called the Document Object Model (DOM).
The DOM has access to every part of a html tag.

<h1 style="background-color: red">Hello</h1>

In the tag above we can see that there are 2 parts, text and style. We can edit
elements of a tag using a litney of commands. We'll start with text.

element.innerHTML = Hello World!;

innerHTMl changes the text. Our tag now looks like the following -
<h1 style="background-color: red">Hello !orld!</h1>

Here's some more examples from W3 schools:
Property	                                 Description
element.innerHTML =  new html content	     Change the inner HTML of an element
element.attribute = new value	Change       the attribute value of an HTML element
element.style.property = new style	       Change the style of an HTML element
element.setAttribute(attribute, value)	   Change the attribute value of an HTML element

// First, let's use the DOM to connect our button to javascript.

// This is the function that will run when we submit
function editCard(){
  // First, lets get the user input and save it to variables. This also uses DOM


  // The second and final step is to change the values in our card.


  // Now that we've changed those values, we want to change the background
  // by editing the style of our element. In this case, we want to change the
  // style.

}
